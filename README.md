## WWI Interactive Timeline

A React/Redux app which creates an interactive timeline of the first world war.

## Motivation

I am creating this project as a way to learn Redux and more about WWI.

## Usage

This project was created with the [react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) Yoeman generator per 114164fd7994e5f62927260cd8b8795a7abe1fc9. See the documentation in that project for how to run and test this project.

## Why World War One?

To quote [Dan Carlin](http://www.dancarlin.com), "I am a fan of history." My WWI interest began in December of 2014 when I started listening to Dan Carlin's excellent [HardCore History Podcast series on this war](http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-50-blueprint-for-armageddon-i/). As a student, my knowledge of the first world war was limited as the second world war was emphasized so much more. What I have learned is that this terrible conflict transitioned the world from the 19th to 20th centuries. It is hard to imagine how different things would be today if WWI had never happened.

As a technologist, WWI is fascinating as it was such a transitional period. Software professionals constantly adapt to a changing technological landscape; often times in organizations and societies which have a hard time keeping up. The armies and countries involved in WWI faced a similar situation but with much higher stakes.
